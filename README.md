## ‚úÖ Notes
- The contact form uses a **mailto** fallback so every submit works out-of-the-box. For automated collection, set a Formspree ID.
- PWA icons are minimal placeholders; replace files in `/public` with your branding.
- This project contains only frontend code. For advanced Stripe flows (Checkout sessions, webhooks), add a small backend or use Stripe Payment Links as configured above.
